### 5330. Maximum Product of Splitted Binary Tree

*Difficulty: Medium*

Given a binary tree root. Split the binary tree into two subtrees by removing 1 edge such that the product of the sums of the subtrees are maximized.

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

Output: 110

Explanation: Remove the red edge and get 2 binary trees with sum 11 and 10. Their product is 110 (11*10)

Constraints:

Each tree has at most 50000 nodes and at least 2 nodes.
Each node's value is between [1, 10000].

## 5331. Jump Game V

*Difficulty: Hard*

Given an array of integers arr and an integer d. In one step you can jump from index i to index:

i + x where: i + x < arr.length and 0 < x <= d.
i - x where: i - x >= 0 and 0 < x <= d.

In addition, you can only jump from index i to index j if arr[i] > arr[j] and arr[i] > arr[k] for all indices k between i and j (More formally min(i, j) < k < max(i, j)).

You can choose any index of the array and start jumping. Return the maximum number of indices you can visit.

Notice that you can not jump outside of the array at any time.

Example 1:

![Example](5331-chart.jpeg)

Input: arr = [6,4,14,6,8,13,9,7,10,6,12], d = 2

Output: 4

Explanation: You can start at index 10. You can jump 10 --> 8 --> 6 --> 7 as shown.

Note that if you start at index 6 you can only jump to index 7. You cannot jump to index 5 because 13 > 9. You cannot jump to index 4 because index 5 is between index 4 and 6 and 13 > 9.
Similarly You cannot jump from index 3 to index 2 or index 1.
